# Simple TCP File Transfer

This directory contains the implementation for a simple file transfer.

To transfer a file:
* Start the server. This is done by typing ./fileServer into the terminal.
* Start the client upload. To upload a certain file, enter ./fileClient.py -f
<FILENAME> into the terminal. In order for the upload to commence, the file
must already exist.
* The file will be uploaded to the server under the name "payload.txt"
